There are two type of style here:
1. Literal style which indicated by a pipe *(|)*
2. folded style which indicated by a right angle bracket *(>)*
Block chomping indicators are *-* and *+", with *-* to strip new lines at the end of the string, and *+* to keep them
Indentation Indicator: just put a number indicating how many white space should lead lines.
