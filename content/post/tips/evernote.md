## How to disable spelling auto-correction

>Tip1: disable from context menu:
```
This was bothering me too!  But, good news: If you right-click anywhere in a note and mouse over 'Spelling and Grammar,' there should be an option titled 'Correct Spelling Automatically.' If you uncheck that, it should stop autocorrecting.
```

> Tip2: Disable globallly on mac:
```
To remove this function, you will need to go into your Mac System Preferences > Language & Region > Keyboard Preferences... > Text > deselect Correct spelling automatically
```
