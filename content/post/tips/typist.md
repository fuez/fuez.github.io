### tips
## [How to create new gtypist lessons?](https://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/doc/)
```
A very easy way to write lessons is to write them in the format that ktouch 1.0 uses, and then convert it to a gtypist lesson using tools/ktouchOLD2typ.pl. 
This will take care of writing “jump-tables”, a menu and a bit more.
